				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>I'm making a summon simulator for Arknights and putting it on my portfolio page!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I organized all of the operators into lists based on their rarities, then wrote a text template that generates a random 6 star operator, two random 5 star operators, five random 4 star operators, two random 3 star and 2 star operators, and a one 1 star operator, alongside a nice message for the user.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I did this generator experiment in a rather tedious way. I manually entered the names of every single operator into several lists for my generator to pull from. It took a while, since there's hundreds of operators in Arknights to choose from. I worked through the wiki to get each name, but I'd imagine that if I were more knowledgeable, I'd be able to snag all of the data from the wiki through some line of code or command with minimal effort. However, I did not know how, so I did it the hard way.</p>
				<p>The other difficulty I ran into was the text formatting. In Glitch, the text was fine, but on github pages, newlines just could not register for me at all. It was a big problem for me because I wrote my text template in a letter/list format, and it would look terrible without line breaks and spaces. I nearly gave up trying to figure it out, but ChatGPT helped me debug by letting me know of some hidden CSS styling options, specifically overflow/white-space. After setting overflow to visible and white-space to prewrap, I finally got new lines on github pages! It was a pretty satisfying result after that.</p>
