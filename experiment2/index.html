				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project aims to create a procedurally generated living impression of an ocean picture swarming with birds!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The program generates various primitives and vertices with randomized elements to determine their position, curvature, etc. Certain elements such as the birds and waves are dependent on mouse movement to act as animated movement.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This assignment was really satisfying. Unlike the previous assignment, I managed to document practically every step of the process. I wrote down each of the ideas I had, what things I backtracked on, and what eureka moments I had. Documenting the process and looking back at what I’ve done makes the project feel sincere and more “real” to me.</p>
				<p>I was trying to play around with a couple of different visual effects and tools, but only some of them ever got into the project. Things like lighting were limited to the WebGL version, and other visual effects like blurring really took a toll on the project’s performance, so I scrapped it. In the end, the project was practically all various primitives and curvy lines. The idea that this is all just primitives and lines makes what I made feel a lot more impressive, though.</p>
				<p>I also experimented a lot with the colors. To make things less stiff I tried playing around with alpha values/opacity. I also ended up making a couple of functions for making waves and sky backgrounds, which were a repetitive process. I’m pretty satisfied with the end result - I think if you look from far away, the generated image and its source look pretty similar.</p>
